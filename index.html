                A digital single-lens reflex camera (digital SLR or DSLR) is a digital camera that combines the optics
                <br />
                and the mechanisms of a single-lens reflex camera with a digital imaging sensor.

        <h1>General info about DSLR cameras</h1>
        <p>
            The reflex design scheme is the primary difference between a DSLR and other digital cameras. In the reflex
            design, light travels through the lens and then to a mirror that alternates to send the image to either a
            prism, which shows the image in the viewfinder, or the image sensor when the shutter release button is
            pressed. The viewfinder of a DSLR presents an image that will not differ substantially from what is captured
            by the camera's sensor as it presents it as a direct optical view through the main camera lens, rather than
            showing an image through a separate secondary lens. DSLRs largely replaced film-based SLRs during the 2000s.
